trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory trajectory #Polynomial trajectory

# This service is intented to interpolate a trajectory using a polynomial
# given an initial and final positions, velocities and accelerations.
# The service only performs the interpolations and thus can be used to
# get either cartesian or articular trajectories.
# The joint names in trajectory message are not defined here and are
# supposed to be set by the caller. This service only performs the
# polynomial interpolation.
