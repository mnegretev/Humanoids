* [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (`ros-noetic-desktop-full` required)
* Gazebo (included in `ros-noetic-desktop-full`)
* RViz (included in `ros-noetic-desktop-full`)
* A lot of patience

## Installation

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/mnegretev/Humanoids.git 
 cd Humanoids
 cd setup/workspace/
 ./SetupDraft.sh
 cd catkin_ws
 catkin_make -j1 -l1
```
### Testing in Desktop

### Configure remote ssh to Raspberry PI

<details><summary>First Method (Static IP with Router)</summary>

To setup a static ip in the raspberry Ethernet port where you can connect to a router, run:
```sh
cd setup/raspberry/
sudo cp 01-static-ip.yaml /etc/netplan/01-static-ip.yaml
sudo netplan apply
```
The static IP is now set to `192.168.0.10`. You can now do `ssh humanoid@192.168.0.10` to connect with Ethernet cable directly to the humanoid.

</details>

<details><summary>Second Method (Static IP with no router)</summary>

If you want to connect directly to Raspberry Pi through Ethernet and share internet at the same time, go to `Settings -> Network -> Wired`, the open settings. In `IPv4` tab, select `Shared to other computers`

```sh
cd setup/raspberry/
sudo cp 01-static-ip.yaml /etc/netplan/02-static-ip.yaml
sudo netplan apply
```
The static IP is now set to `10.42.0.2`. You can now do `ssh humanoid@10.42.0.2` to connect with Ethernet cable directly to the humanoid.
